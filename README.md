# odin-recipes
This is my first "real" project following the odin-project curriculum. The project is about creating a Recipe webpage using the basics of HTML. 
Once I am done with this project,I should have been able to demonstrate basic git and GitHub skills such as pushing and committing.
I will update this again once I have finished the project and list all of the skills I have demonstrated as a self-reflection at the end. See you then!
