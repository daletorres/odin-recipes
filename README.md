# odin-recipes
This is my first "real" project following the odin-project curriculum. The project is about creating a Recipe webpage using the basics of HTML. 
Once I am done with this project,I should have been able to demonstrate basic git and GitHub skills such as pushing and committing.
I will update this again once I have finished the project and list all of the skills I have demonstrated as a self-reflection at the end. See you then!

Alright so 1 hour later, I was able to finish the project and it's been both fun and fulfilling seeing my first project on github, I was able to use most of the skills I learned from the odin project curriculum like creating a boilerplate from scratch, adding and pushing commits to github on the terminal, using mostly the terminal throughout the process and basically creating the whole thing. Anything I didn't know or remember I just googled so that's that >:D anyway, progress is progress.
